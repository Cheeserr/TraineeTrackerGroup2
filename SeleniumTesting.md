# Selenium Testing

## Introduction

The Selenium Testing add-on project was undertaken to further test the Trainee Tracker app by simulating user input and interaction with automated Selenium tests. The tests were also BDD oriented using the SpecFlow .NET framework.

## Additional Packages Used

- Selenium.Webdriver
- Selenium.Webdriver.ChromeDriver
- Selenium.Webdriver.GeckoDriver
- SpecFlow
- SpecFlow.NUnit
- SpecFlow.Plus.LivingDocPlugin
- System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager

## Structure

For this add-on testing project we decided to separate it from the rest of the previous work, so we created a separate Test Project, along with an API Test Project and framework. In the Test Project, there are two main directories, "lib" and "Utils".

lib holds the child directories "driver_config", "pages", and "tests".

- driver_config contains the Selenium Driver config file that sets up the driver for use in all of the automated tests that use Selenium.
- pages contains all of the Page Object Model files that contain the testing framework that helps with testing
- tests contains all of the website tests that were written using Selenium and Specflow

Utils contains additional utilities that interact with the tests.

## What Was Tested

Before the project was undertaken, a plan was devised so that all testers knew exactly what was to be tested. We came up with several epics, user stories and test cases that were used to gauge testing completion. After these were completed, some Exploratory Testing was undertaken to find bugs in the software and Issues/Defects were noted.

### Epics

- Epic 1 - As a Trainee I want to view and edit my trainee tracker so that I may keep track of my progress
- Epic 2 - As a Trainer, I want to be able to view and edit trainee profiles, so that I may show them to clients
- Epic 3 - As a trainee I want to View and edit my Profile so that it may be sent to clients
- Epic 4 - As a trainer, I want to be able to view changes to all of my trainees' trackers so that I may track their progress
- Epic 5 - As an admin I want to be able to track and update trainers and trainees so that I can manage the organsiation
- Epic 6 - As a user I would like to be able to log in to my account and update my details.

### Exploratory Testing

- e1.1 - As a Trainee can I access the Create page?
- e1.2 - As a user can I access the Create page for a Trainee that does not exist?
- e1.3 - As a Trainee can I access the Delete page?
- e1.4 - As a user can I access the Details page for a tracker that does not exist?

### Issues/Defects

From some of the exploratory tests and also one of the test cases, Issues/Defects were found and tickets were created.

- e1.1 Trainee can access Create page
- e1.2 Can access Create page for a Trainee that does not exist
- 1.2.3 Can access another Trainee's trackers as a Trainee

# Living Docs

We've created a living docs report covering our Selenium tests. It is in the main folder of the application.

# API Testing

We've created a basic API testing framework which tests few of the API endpoints and these are:

- Create Tracker
- Create Tracker By Id
- Get Tracker Details by Id
- Get Trackers by Id
- Delete User
- Get User Details By Id
- Get Users

All of the services are using the same base service, so they are easily extendable and easy to modify.
